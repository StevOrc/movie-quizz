Movie quizz

    This app is a small Frontend Javascript project based on the React framework.
    It will cover basics of React concepts (state, props system, hooks, routing, events...)

The app is a quiz on movies. The app will make a request to the API https://api.themoviedb.org/3
We are going to fetch the image of the movie and the image of the differents actors concerned by the question and show them on the screen.

Deps :
    - axios
    - react-router-dom
